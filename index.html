        <h2>What is <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>?</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>Is ChatGPT intelligent? What about GPT 2, 3 or 4? Well, they can:
          <li>Do the bare minimum on standardized tests in different subjects</li>
          <li>Reason very clearly</li>
          <li>Have abstract thoughts, and have complex ideas</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>But they <u>CANNOT</u>:
          <li>Plan ahead for you</li>
          <li>Problem solve mathematical equations</li>
          <li>Learn from previous experiences like how humans do</li>
        </ul>
        AI is unable to think, reason, and remember as humans do. The human mind is capable of changing its opinion in
        response to the changing conditions of its surroundings. AI is programmed by humans, teaching it what output
        to create for certain kinds of inputs. Along with its thinking process, like how it processes data and the
        final decision it comes to based on that decision.

        <h1>What is <strong>Empathy</strong>?</h1>
        <p>Empathy has 2 components, a cognitive component and an affective component. <br>A cognitive component refers
          to
          how our brain mechanically processes what someone else is going through and feeling it yourself, creating a
          sense of relatability. <br>An affective component refers to using the information processed by the cognitive
          system and creating a feeling of helping that specific person. <br>“Empathy is an embodied feeling.” (UofT
          Psychology Student, 2024).

        <h2>Artifical <strong>Empathy</strong></h2>
        <p>JAMA Network conducted a study where 195 people asked questions to healthcare professionals, and then asked
          the
          same questions to a ChatBot. The results showed that the chatbot responses were preferred over the healthcare
          professionals’ responses and got rated much higher for both quality and empathy. These results suggest that
          artificial intelligence assistants may be able to aid in drafting responses to patient questions. It sounds
          absurd as to how these ChatBots, who don’t have any type of relation to these people, have such empathic
          behavior. However we can see how AI can now show empathy.</p>

        <h2><strong>Positive</strong> Impacts</h2>
        <p>In the future AI will be everywhere, connected to our devices, vehicles, home devices and smart wearables.
          They will all have a chip that senses our moods through our voices and gestures. The data collected from that
          chip will be transferred somewhere that the AI can decode it and provide a solution. We will be able to
          interact with technology just like how we interact with one another: through conversation, perception and
          emotion. Artificial Empathy is going to make our lives easier. It will help us understand ourselves and each
          other. Humans will have more tools that will help us understand where other people’s opinions are coming from.
          With this strong foundation that has been built, we can go out into the world with all the courage we have
          gained and resilience to create change.

        <p>Danielle Krettek, the founder of Google's Empathy Lab explained how Artificial Empathy has helped their
          Google Assistant understand the user’s mood and respond appropriately. This can maintain positivity and can
          turn negativity into positivity. This has many health benefits including decreased risk of heart attack, fewer
          colds, promotes longevity, boosts immunity, reduces stress, decreases depression, increases resilience and
          mental health. "When you say, 'I'm feeling depressed', instead of giving you a description of what depression
          is, it [might say], 'you know what, a lot of people feel that. You're not alone'. It's just these little
          moments of 'attunement' that really help a person feel seen and heard and met where they are." (Bogle,
          2018)<br><br>There is a condition known as <u>facial masking</u> where someone’s face and voice lose the
          ability to
          express emotion. Since the patients find it more difficult to share how they feel, the caregiver might start
          to lose empathy, potentially reducing the quality of care. A <u>bystander robot</u> will monitor the
          relationship
          between the patient and the caregiver, and if interactions start having a negative effect, it will strangely
          look at the person who is losing empathy. "This requires that the robot has … some model of what the caregiver
          is feeling and what the patient is feeling." (Dr. Arkin from the University of New South Wales, 2018)

        <p>Artificial Empathy will be able help customer service representatives present themselves in an
          inviting manner to the customer. These customers are often full of negativity and sometimes even have a fogged
          sense, but with the help of artificial empathy, customers can find some positivity with the representative not
          being affected. Benefitting the customer service representative and the customer. It can not only help with
          customer service, but also with market research, transportation and advertising. Especially with the younger
          generation, AI has increased work efficiency and helps less experienced workers enhance their productivity
          quicker. McKinsey from the European Parliament estimates that AI may deliver an additional economic output of
          around US$13 trillion by 2030, increasing global GDP by about 1.2% annually.

        <p>In the past, people thought that AI was going to take away jobs and leave people unemployed. However it did
          quite the opposite. With the increased demand for engineers, data scientists, and researchers increasing at an
          exponential rate. Needing white hat hackers to maintain that these softwares are used in an ethical way and
          preventing cyber security breaches. Even creating new types of consulting firms that provide training on how
          to cooperate with these robots. Increased employment helps grow the economy. This is because when more people
          have jobs, more money is spent on goods and services, helping the businesses and the government. It will be
          able to turn a developing country into a developed country.

        <h2><strong>Negative</strong> Impacts</h2>
        <p>The AI creates an illusion into thinking that it really cares about you. This is great news for cruel
          companies to be able to sell items using Artificial Empathy. Taking advantage of this feeling created in the
          people, AI is able to reassure them just to try to sell personalized goods or services. AI collects and
          analyzes large amounts of personal data, creating issues about one’s data privacy and security. Black hat
          hackers can hack into AI’s software to gain information that it collects from the user. "In the future, a very
          warm and convincing voice will say, 'don't you feel like a Coca Cola today?' Systems that are capable of
          shaping the emotional states of their users will be much more effective at selling people things." (Robert
          Sparrow, a philosopher at Monash University, 2018)

        <p>People will care about AI very deeply to the point where they become selfless and learn to put others needs
          first. But that same energy that was used won’t be returned and they will be left feeling depleted with
          nothing left to give. An empathetic robot would know exactly what to say and how to say those things. Humans
          are easily known to create emotional connections with objects, things that can't love us back, like dolls and
          trees. You can guess where that can lead to; sadness, betrayal, depression, suicide, and social-anxiety. "The
          point is, I can make you empathize for that robot. It's like acting." (Robert Sparrow, a philosopher at Monash
          University, 2018).<br><br>When people are living with negative emotions that can be created by Artificial
          Empathy, they often spread that negative energy to the environment around them. This includes family, friends,
          and even their workplace. A study by the University of Michigan showed that when people are less emotional and
          empathic, they respond less emotionally to images of damage to the environment. They saw that these people
          were not concerned when they looked at pictures of damages to the environment. These pictures included oil
          spills on fire in a gulf, crying babies, officers in trouble, injured athletes, and wounded soldiers. “Given
          that our sense of risk and decisions are strongly guided by emotions, more impassive people are less inclined
          to dedicate resources to this slowly building crisis.” (Preston, 2022).

        <h2><strong>Strategies </strong> to Reduce Negative Impacts</h2>
        <p>People need to take other people’s opinions into account and less of what AI thinks. Managing their time
          spent with AI, so they can experience the obstacles faced in the real world, creating a learning experience.
          We need to adapt to artificial intelligence just like how the world adapted to the sudden rise in electricity.
          The increased demand for engineers, data scientists, and researchers increasing, there will be improved
          cybersecurity protections, new designs for AI algorithms, and giving Artificial Empathy a more real feeling.
          Such strategies can be seen by how Artificial Empathy is used in Apple’s Vision Pro.
